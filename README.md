# CalendarCustomize Project

## Overview
The CalendarCustomize project is a Swift package that provides a versatile SwiftUI component for displaying a calendar grid, including a single column layout option. This component allows seamless navigation between months and enables users to select dates, enhancing SwiftUI applications with robust calendar functionalities and flexible UI customization.

## Components
The project consists of the following main components:

### CalendarView
- `CalendarView` is a SwiftUI `View` that displays a grid of dates representing a calendar month.
- Users can navigate between months using navigation buttons.
- Dates within the calendar can be selected by tapping on them.

### Helper Functions

## Usage
To use the `CalendarCustomize` component in your SwiftUI project:
1. Import the `CalendarCustomize` module.
2. Initialize a `Binding<Date?>` variable to hold the selected date.
3. Add a `CalendarView` instance to your SwiftUI view hierarchy, passing the `Binding<Date?>` variable to it.
